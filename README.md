<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/Arinautic/arinautic.github.io/blob/main/screenshot.png)

As a Custom ROM user myself, I have noticed that others are skeptical when it comes to installing one, because they tend to find it scary. That is exactly why I have created this application.

What does ROMifier do?:
* ROMifier removes the need for using the command line.
* You need no previous Custom ROM knowledge.
* Everything is explained using screenshots and detailed explanations.

Of course, if you need to do anything that is not covered inside of this application, you will need to use the command line. However, I am open to suggestions for features, and everyone is allowed to
fork the project if they have ideas themselves.
